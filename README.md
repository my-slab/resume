##### Facebook use in Affective Disorders (FAD) Study (Contractor)

Worked with Beyond Blue, MAPrc and the School of Intelligent Systems at RMIT to create a platform for subjects to self-report their mood on a daily basis. This integrated with Facebook and compared changes in social media use by an individual before and during a bipolar relapse. This was completed using Python (Flask).

##### Get Me To Class (Contractor)

Worked with The Mornington Peninsula Shire and the School of Computer Science and IT at RMIT to build a Python (Django) REST API to support two mobile applications. This helped students travel to tertiary institutions, encouraged them to consider public transport options and arrange formal car-pooling. A student's individual timetable synced with the journey planner to calculate departure time and public transport routes. A further option allowed students, wanting to combine public transport and car-pooling, to link via Facebook and Twitter.
